# AI-Skincare-Safety-Checker
This is a simple AI-powered skincare safety checker I built using Python, EasyOCR, and Gradio. Just upload a product image, select your skin type, and it tells you if the ingredients are safe — plus gives skincare tips and product suggestions. Built it to make skincare smarter and easier for everyone.


I’m not sure why the output isn’t showing in the notebook, but I’ve uploaded a separate image of the output.

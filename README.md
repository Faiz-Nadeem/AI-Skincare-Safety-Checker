# AI-Skincare-Safety-Checker
This is a simple AI-powered skincare safety checker I built using Python, EasyOCR, and Gradio. Just upload a product image, select your skin type, and it tells you if the ingredients are safe â€” plus gives skincare tips and product suggestions. Built it to make skincare smarter and easier for everyone.
